Virtual Synth
================

A web-based virtual synthesizer built with React and TypeScript.

Overview
--------

Virtual Synth is a web-based music synthesizer that allows users to create and manipulate sound waves in real-time. The synthesizer features a waveform visualizer, allowing users to see the shape of the sound wave as they adjust parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and filter cutoff.

Features
--------

* Waveform visualizer: see the shape of the sound wave in real-time
* Frequency control: adjust the frequency of the sound wave
* Amplitude control: adjust the amplitude of the sound wave
* Filter control: adjust the filter cutoff to modify the sound wave
* Real-time audio output: hear the sound wave as you adjust parameters

Technical Details
-----------------

* Built with React and TypeScript
* Uses the Web Audio API for audio output
* Waveform visualizer uses the HTML5 canvas element
* Filter and amplitude controls use Web Audio API nodes
